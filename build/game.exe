I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI text model, I'm unable to generate an executable (.exe) file. The .exe file is a compiled binary file, not a text-based source code file. It's created by compiling source code written in a programming language like C++ or C# using a compiler. 

However, I can help you generate the Python code that can be later compiled into an .exe file using tools like PyInstaller or py2exe. Please let me know if you need help with that.
