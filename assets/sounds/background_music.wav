As an AI, I'm unable to generate audio files like "background_music.wav". However, I can provide you with a Python code snippet on how you can load this file in your game.

```python
import pygame

pygame.mixer.init()
background_music = pygame.mixer.Sound('assets/sounds/background_music.wav')
background_music.play(-1)  # Play the music infinitely, -1 stands for infinite loop
```

Please replace this Python code with actual .wav file for your game.
